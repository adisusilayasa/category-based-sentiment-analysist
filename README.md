## Quick start
This project aimed as my thesis in my college. In this project I implement text category classification and sentiment analysist using convolutional neural network. The project was build using python flask framework as back-end. This project already deployed on heroku. It can accesible using this linkcategory-based-sentiment.herokuapp.com but it's gonna take some time to load because I used free tier.

## How it works
You just need simply add any review about clothing or fashion. The application will classify your review and then implement sentiment analysist and show it on chart so you can easier understand the results.
