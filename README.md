## Quick start
This project aimed as my thesis in my college. In this project I implement text category classification and sentiment analysist using convolutional neural network. The project was build using python flask framework as back-end. This project already deployed on heroku. It can accesible using this link <category-based-sentiment.herokuapp.com but> it's gonna take some time to load because I used free tier.

## How it works
### Deployed Version
You just need simply add any review about clothing or fashion. The application will classify your review and then implement sentiment analysist and show it on chart so you can easier understand the results.

### Local Host
You need to install all requirement.txt then you need to extract the model from rar located on /root/static/model. You also need to extract the model on the same directory as the rar version.

## Technology used
- Python (flask)
- Tensorflow
- HTML
